# Volca-Sync-Divider

An Arduino driven Korg Volca sync divider. It's basically a simple "hack job" to add some versatility to the volcas.
The arduino recieves a sync pulse from a volca, and outputs 2 or more pulses at a lower BPM while remaining in time. 

Put together and tested with an Arduino Nano, Arduino Pro Micro, Volca Beats, Volca Keys and Volca Bass. The Volca Beats was the main sync out. 
  
DISCLAIMER: Due to the quirkiness of Volcas, your mileage may vary.
